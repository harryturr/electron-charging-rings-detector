# electron-charging-rings-detector
An algorithm developed by Maxime Perdriat and me to use computer vision to detect charging rings which are the result of single electron transfer.

The eventual goal of this algorithm is to use it to automate our low temperature atomic force microscope. By scanning a large area, we can use the algorithm to find rings of specific parameters, and drive the tip to the region of interest for scanning.

Additionally, we can extract physical parameters of the rings using the algorithm.

# status
Here I have just dropped the current code base. It uses a local and a global method to find the charging rings.

# to do
* documentation / explanation of algorithms employed
